A primary goal of the restoration project is to expand learning opportunities for students and visitors to our campus.
We envision that the space will inspire outdoor exploration, connections to natural environments and help develop a 
strong a sense of place. The site will include outdoor classroom spaces, informational kiosks,
and other related opportunities to achieve these goals. Outdoor classrooms will be available for instructional use, as well as a place for students
looking to find a place to study. Kiosks, placed across the landscape, will provide information about the history of the land,
its current state and ongoing research projects. This minimal infrastructure will maintain a low profile on the natural landscape
and will allow for both active and passive learning opportunities.
